#### I want to fix a bug

If you are fixing a bug, you must follow these guidelines:

- Make sure the bug is reproducible and affects a wide variety of users.
- The root cause of the bug must be the Android app itself, not the server or the API.
- The root cause of the bug must be the Android app itself, not the device or the Android version.

#### I want to add a feature

**All features must be discussed with the app's maintainer before you start working on them!** If
you are adding a feature, you must follow these guidelines:

- The feature must be useful to a wide variety of users.
- UI/UX is centrally managed by Revolt's design team. Make sure your feature aligns closely with the
  current design as well as [Material 3](https://m3.material.io/).
- If you need any new UI, you are recommended to request a design from the design team and implement
  it as per the design. If your UI/UX is not up to the mark, your PR may be rejected by the design
  team.
- The feature must not be a duplicate of an existing feature.
- The feature must not be a part of the [Roadmap](#) (To be published).

## In General, ...

- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for your commit
  messages. This helps in generating changelogs and tracking changes.
- Make sure your code is easy to understand. You need not document every line of code, but if
  something is not immediately obvious to a seasoned Android developer, you should add a comment.
- Make sure your code is well-formatted. You can use Android Studio's built-in code formatter to
  format your code.
- Make sure your code 'fits in' with the rest of the codebase.
- Make sure your code is well-tested. You should write unit tests for your code if applicable.
